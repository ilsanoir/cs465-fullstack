Initially, the project used Express HTML and then eventually moved over to Javascript and a single-page application (SPA). HTML is static in nature, making it less flexible and less interactive with the backend of the web applicatuion. 
Javascript on the otherhand, worked dynamically between the front end backend to deliver a more complete and easier to modify web application. The SPAs advantage largely came from its caching capabilities, reducing the load times and generally making for 
a more efficient application.

The NoSQL MongoDB database was easier to modify and scale to the meet the needs of the application. This made it the optimal choice for the website.

JSON being a standardized format for data allowed for easier frontend to backend processing of object data. The standardized nature of the data also makes it more flexible, as the standardized data can be stored once and then pulled in a variety of contexts.

An instance of the code being refractored was for the header and footer sections of the webpage rendring. The header and footer got separated into individual files that were referenced in the webpage render. This cleaned up the code significantly, improving readability,
as well as allowing for easier editing of those sections if necessary. This also allowed for those UI elements to be reused if necessary, saving time and improving the efficiency of the web design process.

Methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are what drive web applications, they determine what kind of functionality frontend elements actually provide, as well as provide a structure for what is to be expected of the backend. Endpoints function as the results of those
methods. Methods lead to endpoints. Endpoints and methods should be tested regularly to ensure proper functionality. Testing can be done by actually booting up the web application and trying to reach an endpoint. Or testing can be done with software like postman, to send, 
edit, delete, or request data through the web application. Security in such a web application largely comes from input validation and encryption. All user inputs should be validated, and otherwise accounted for to prevent exploits. Passwords and other sensitve information 
should be encrypted when being sent to the backend and should be encrypted when being received from the backend to ensure privacy and security.

This course has been very hands-on for me. It was an area that I'm not familiar with, so learning about fullstack development first-hand was very intriguing and fascinating. It has become something that I'd like to pursue further and will be investing more time into 
further understanding. The most important skill that I have taken away from this experience was decision making. Choosing what approach to take, what areas of code to modularize, what framework to consider, and so on, are very important skills that I hadn't thought 
keenly about until now. I believe that having the knowledge and the confidence to make such decisions will help me stand out as a prospective hire for overseeing such projects.
